The schedule of this year looks something like this:
Month 04, discussion with other associations on when the preliminaries can be held (organized by individual universities). Month 06, possibly preliminaries Month 09, the preliminaries Month 10, BAPC21 This planning is subject to change as the Benelux still faces problems with COVID-19.</description></item><item><title>Registration</title><link>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/registration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:41:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/registration/</guid><description>Registration The registration will open after the preliminaries have taken place.
The slots per institution for BAPC21 are limited. As there tends to be more teams than slots available, your institution can hold preliminary contests to determine which teams qualify for BAPC21. The preliminaries are expected to be held in the summer of 2021.
Registration for a preliminary at your institution is independent of a registration for BAPC21. Information on how to register a team representing your university is often arranged via your teaching staff or the study association representing either the mathematics or computer science department.</description></item><item><title>Contest</title><link>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/contest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:41:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/contest/</guid><description>Contest Due to COVID-19 measures, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether we will be able to hold an on-site contest at the VU Amsterdam campus. We are working on both on-site and online contests and will inform you as soon as possible. Ideas have been pitched in April to the other institutions.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:41:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/contact/</guid><description>Contact If you have any questions or want to the contact the 2021 BAPC committee, please drop us an email at: organization “at” BAPC “dot” EU (not active yet).
